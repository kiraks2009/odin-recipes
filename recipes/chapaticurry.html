        <ul>
            <li>Roll half of the beef mince into a ball and pat it down until a finger thick, bigger than palm size patty. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
            <li>Fry both patties with salt and pepper for 2 and a half minutes a side. Add 1 cheese single to one of the patties.</li>
            <li>Toast the burger buns on a dry pan on medium heat until one of the sides is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Mix all the sauce ingredients and set aside.</li>
            <li>Time to build this bad boy! Spread burger sauce on a bun, sprinkle diced onion, shredded lettuce, place the patty with cheese, place another slice of bun.</li>
            <li>Then more sauce, more onion, shredded lettuce, gherkin slices, another patty, and the last slice of bun!</li>
            <li>Dig in and get lovinâ€™ it!</li>
